Q1:If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: No, we are not allowed to create multiple constructor methods with the same type of parameters, even if they differ by the order of parameters

Q2:Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

Answer: Java operates as a pass-by-value language, where alterations to an object's state within a method reflect outside it due to working on the same object instance. Nevertheless, if the reference to a new object is reassigned within the method, it does not impact the reference outside the method.
