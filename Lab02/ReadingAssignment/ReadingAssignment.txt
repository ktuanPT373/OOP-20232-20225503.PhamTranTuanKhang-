Question : When should accessors methods be used.

Accessor methods should be used when you need to retrieve the values of private fields in a class from outside the class.
They provide controlled access to the fields by returning their values, allowing encapsulation and maintaining the principle of data hiding.
Accessor methods help in implementing the concept of encapsulation, enhancing the security and maintainability of the codebase. 
Moreover, they enable the class to expose only the necessary information to external users while keeping the internal implementation details hidden.
