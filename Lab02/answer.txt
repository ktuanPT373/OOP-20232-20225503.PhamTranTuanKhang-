Q1:If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:No, Java does not allow you to create multiple constructor methods with the same parameter types, even if they differ by the order of parameters.

Q2:Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

Answer:Java is a pass-by-value programming language. Changes to the state of the object within the method are visible outside the method because they are operating on the same object instance. However, if you reassign the reference to a new object within the method, it won't affect the reference outside the method.
